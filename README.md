# LeetCode Solutions - [Rushikesh0523](https://github.com/Rushikesh0523/LeetCode.git)

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! Here, I have compiled my solutions to various problems that I have solved on LeetCode. Each solution is well-structured and categorized by difficulty level and problem type.

## üìö Problem Categories

The problems are organized into categories based on their types and data structures/algorithms. Below are some of the key categories:

- **Array**
- **String**
- **Linked List**
- **Stack & Queue**
- **Tree & Graph**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Greedy**
- **Backtracking**
- **Bit Manipulation**
- **Math**
- **Recursion**

## üöÄ Solutions Overview

The solutions include:
- **Problem description**: Short summary of the problem.
- **Approach**: Explanation of the approach used to solve the problem.
- **Code**: Clean, readable, and optimized solution.
- **Time and space complexity**: Big-O analysis of the solution.

## üîç How to Navigate

You can browse through the solutions by problem category or difficulty level. Each problem is stored in a folder with the problem name and includes a `README.md` with a detailed explanation.

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Array
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Problem_1_Two_Sum
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ solution.cpp
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Problem_3_House_Robber
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ solution.java
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
...
```

## üìä Difficulty Levels

I have categorized problems by difficulty levels:
- **Easy**: Beginner-friendly problems.
- **Medium**: Intermediate-level problems.
- **Hard**: Challenging problems for advanced coding practice.

## üìù Notes & Tips

- Each solution has been tested with multiple test cases to ensure correctness.
- Comments are added in code wherever necessary to explain complex logic.
- For each problem, I also mention alternative approaches if applicable.

## üí° Getting Started

To use these solutions:
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rushikesh0523/LeetCode.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the problem directory of your interest.
3. Read the problem's `README.md` for detailed explanations and the solution code.
