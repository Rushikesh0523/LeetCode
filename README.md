# LeetCode Solutions - [Rushikesh0523](https://github.com/Rushikesh0523/LeetCode.git)

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! Here, I have compiled my solutions to various problems that I have solved on LeetCode. Each solution is well-structured and categorized by difficulty level and problem type.

## 📚 Problem Categories

The problems are organized into categories based on their types and data structures/algorithms. Below are some of the key categories:

- **Array**
- **String**
- **Linked List**
- **Stack & Queue**
- **Tree & Graph**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Greedy**
- **Backtracking**
- **Bit Manipulation**
- **Math**
- **Recursion**

## 🚀 Solutions Overview

The solutions include:
- **Problem description**: Short summary of the problem.
- **Approach**: Explanation of the approach used to solve the problem.
- **Code**: Clean, readable, and optimized solution.
- **Time and space complexity**: Big-O analysis of the solution.

## 🔍 How to Navigate

You can browse through the solutions by problem category or difficulty level. Each problem is stored in a folder with the problem name and includes a `README.md` with a detailed explanation.

```
├── Array
│   ├── Problem_1_Two_Sum
│   │   ├── solution.cpp
│   │   └── README.md
│   ├── Problem_2_Reverse_Integer
│   │   ├── solution.py
│   │   └── README.md
├── Dynamic_Programming
│   ├── Problem_3_House_Robber
│   │   ├── solution.java
│   │   └── README.md
...
```

## 📊 Difficulty Levels

I have categorized problems by difficulty levels:
- **Easy**: Beginner-friendly problems.
- **Medium**: Intermediate-level problems.
- **Hard**: Challenging problems for advanced coding practice.

## 📝 Notes & Tips

- Each solution has been tested with multiple test cases to ensure correctness.
- Comments are added in code wherever necessary to explain complex logic.
- For each problem, I also mention alternative approaches if applicable.

## 💡 Getting Started
